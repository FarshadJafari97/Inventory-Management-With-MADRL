# Optimizing Inventory Management in Perishable Supply Chains Using Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Blood Supply Chain Case Study)
## Overview
This repository contains the implementation code for my master's thesis titled: "Optimizing Inventory Management in Perishable Supply Chains Using Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Case of Study: Blood Supply Chain)."

The goal of this project is to develop a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning model that optimizes blood inventory management in a two-echelon perishable supply chain. The system consists of a supplier and two distributors (hospitals), under a vendor-managed inventory (VMI) system. The model includes the capability for lateral inventory transfers between hospitals to ensure timely fulfillment of demand and minimize waste.

Please note: This repository includes the code for the model implementation and simulation setup, but it does not contain the final results.
